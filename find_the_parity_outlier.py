# You are given an list (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The list is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the list as an argument and returns this 'outlier' N.


# find_the_parity_outlier([2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36])
# Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

# find_the_parity_outlier([160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21])
# Should return: 160 (the only even number)
